Description
- Act 1:
    - The game plays a tune while the LEDs light up before starting the game.

- Act 2:

        - If the user presses within a short time, a happy tune plays while the Green LED flashes thrice.
        - If the user fails to press the button within a short time, a sad tune plays while the Red LED flashes thrice.
